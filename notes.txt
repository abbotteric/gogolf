Equations of motion

1. object under gravity

f(t) = c
f'(t) = (dc)t + c  # dc = rate of change in position = velocity (v)
f''(t) = 1/2(dv)t^2 + vt + c #dv = rate of change of velocity = acceleration (a)

a = 9.8 m/s/s

Initial conditions:
1. Ball shot straight up at 10m/s
2. Normal gravity
3. No air resistance
4. Started at position of 0.

dv = -9.8m/s/s
v = 10m/s

f''(t) = position of ball as a function of time (t)
f''(t) = 1/2(-9.8)t^2 + 10t + 0


2. Coordinate mapping

worldSpace.x/worldSpace.max.x = imageSpace.x/imageSpace.max.x
imageSpace.x = imageSpace.max.x (worldSpace.x/worldSpace.max.x)

3. Force-based calculation

Mass of golf ball = 0.04593 kg
Radius of golf ball = 0.02135m

7i
ball speed: 118mph * 0.447 = 52.75m/s
impact duration = 0.1s
acceleration = 52.75/0.1 = 527.5m/s/s
force = 0.04593 * 527.5 = 24.228 N

launch angle = 22Â° = 22/180*pi = 0.384r
vertical component = 24.228 * sin(0.384) = 9.076 N
horizontal component = 24.228 * cos(0.384)  22.464 N

F_drag = 1/2*p*v^2*C_d*A
  p = fluid density ~ 1.225 kg/m^3
  v = velocity
  C_d = coefficient of drag ~ 0.5 for an average ball
  A = cross section normal to drag force = pi * 0.02135^2 = 0.00143 m^2

F_g = m*G = 0.04593 * -9.8 =  -0.4305 N

Force calculation for each step:
1. Impact force
2. Drag force
3. Gravitational force
